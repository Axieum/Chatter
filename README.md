## Features

### :people_holding_hands: Discord

Bring your Minecraft world into your [Discord](https://discord.com) guild.

### :innocent: Filtering

Clean up your chat by filtering and/or replacing words or phrases.

### :scream: Named Animal/Monster Death Messages

Name an animal or monster with a [Name Tag](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Name_Tag) to see their death message in the
chat. Have closure knowing what happened to them.

### :smile: Nicknames

Appear in the chat under an alias that's easier for others to remember, or to conceal your identity.

### :dart: Ranged Messages

Change how far a player's message can travel, i.e. cross-dimensionality and/or within 250 blocks.

### :art: Styling

Change how players see each other's messages. We can all agree that the classic Minecraft chat format is quite
lacklustre to the point where it becomes hard to read. Chatter allows you to tweak the chat format - go ahead and add
colour!
